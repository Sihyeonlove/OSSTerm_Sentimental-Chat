# OSS Termproject - "AI Chat Surport"

___

**"AI secretary for perfect chat"**

Have you ever had a chat with someone you need to get to know, and didn't know what to say? Or is there a time when you don't notice that someone like that seems to get angry but doesn't put it into words and gets subtle? ~~There are people I miss... I miss you more as I make this.~~

So it was created. This program, based on their chats, becomes themselves. In other words, it's a "conversation sandbag" that provides feedback.

In this way, achieve a smooth "tikitaka" with the object you're going to talk about!

This program used a pipeline module using huggingface. It was also applied based on the contents of the lecture.

This program is designed for submitting OSS assignments at Gachon University.
